> **Abstract**
>
> With the threats to cybersecurity ever-increasing, prematurely detecting
> vulnerabilities in software systems is deemed as one of the promising ways to
> thwart exploitation attempts from attackers at the fundamental level. In this
> talk, we first briefly recap software vulnerabilities and move on to the
> historical evolution of vulnerability detection techniques (i.e., how it has
> evolved up until now). Finally, we go over the current most popular
> vulnerability detection technique (i.e., fuzzing) and discuss its possible
> future development.
