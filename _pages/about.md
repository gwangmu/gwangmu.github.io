In academia, I'm mainly interested in dynamic software testing (or "fuzzing") and Linux kernel security. I also have a research background in compiler optimization and computer architecture, and have studied physics and astrology during my Bachelor's years. Currently, I work at [Swiss National Computer Centre (CSCS)](https://cscs.ch) as a software engineer for container engine development.
